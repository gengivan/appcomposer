## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

The translator3 relies on grunt-preprocess. It will behave differently depending on whether the
NODE_ENV is set to 'production' or to 'development'. Please, remember to set it to 'production' in production.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
