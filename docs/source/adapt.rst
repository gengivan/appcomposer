Adapt Composer
==============

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Do you want to customize your concept maps or hypotheses? In this section, 
we will learn to adapt these tools with our own set of elements. As you will see
, only a few clicks are necessary to achieve this goal. That is the motto of
App Composer, the Go-Lab application creator for teachers.

First, let's open the homepage of the App Composer. The adaptor composer
can be found there. Click on the button on the right side of the screen:

.. note::
    
    The following adaptations are adaptations of existing tools developed by
    third parties. In each section it will be clearly displayed who are the
    authors of those tools.

Creating a Concept Map adaption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The Concept Mapper is an adaptation of the amazing `Concept Mapper <http://go-lab.gw.utwente.nl/sources/tools/conceptmap/src/main/webapp/conceptmap0.6.html>`_
    developed in the University of Twente.


A concept map may have multiple variations. If we want to add our own concepts,
we will start by selecting this type of tool in the list: 

.. image:: /_static/cmap-00.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

Once the preferred type has been selected, the name and (optional) description 
have to be inserted in the next page. The "Build it" button has to be pressed 
to go to the next step:

.. image:: /_static/cmap-01.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

If everything was done as described, you will find an empty form. Proceed to 
enter the concepts for your map by typing them consecutively. Press enter before 
adding each concept. When you have finished, click on "Save". If everything went 
smoothly, a green notification will show up in the top of the page:

.. image:: /_static/cmap-02.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

As a final step, click on the preview tab to check your work. Drag one of the 
"select or type" boxes in the left toolbar and drop it in the concept map space.
All the concepts that you saved are now available in the dropdown menu:

.. image:: /_static/cmap-03.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

You are all set to import the map into your Graasp space or ILS. Copy the 
"Widget link" in the preview tab, as it is shown above and discover what your 
students can do: 

.. image:: /_static/cmap-04.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

Creating a Hypothesis adaption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The Hypothesis is an adaptation of the amazing `Hypothesis tool <http://go-lab.gw.utwente.nl/sources/tools/hypothesis/src/main/webapp/hypothesis0.9.html>`_
    developed in the University of Twente.

Teachers may be interested in generating a specific set of conditions for the
hypothesis tool. In that case, they can select this type of tool in the adaptor: 

.. image:: /_static/hypo-00.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

Give a name and (optional) description to your creation in the next page and
push the "Build it" button: 

.. image:: /_static/hypo-01.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

Once the two previous steps have been completed, a list of elements is shown. 
Feel free to edit your own collection of conditionals, inputs and outputs. 
Remember to press enter before adding a new variable. Click on "Save" to store
your values in the App Composer:

.. image:: /_static/hypo-02.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

Behold your creation in all its glory in the "Preview" tab:

.. image:: /_static/hypo-03.png                           
   :width: 640 px      
   :align: center

To import this Hypothesis instance into your Graasp space or ILS, simply copy 
and paste the "Widget link". 

Creating a Experiment Design adaption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The EDT is an adaptation of the amazing `Experiment Design Tool <http://go-lab.gw.utwente.nl/sources/tools/edt/edt.html>`_
    developed in the University of Twente.

How can students test a hypothesis and know if it is valid? The tool that is  
described in this block may help with such question. Let's create an experiment
design with a specific set of variables.

.. image:: /_static/edt-00.png
   :width: 640
   :target: /_static/edt-00.png
   :align: center     

As usual, a domain name for our EDT is mandatory. If you consider it necessary,
provide a description. Now we can begin to build the design.

.. image:: /_static/edt-01.png
   :width: 640
   :target: /_static/edt-01.png
   :align: center 

The process for achieving our goal requires completing four steps with their
corresponding tabs: two for the domain and other two for the experiment contents.
In the first tab there are three tables: object properties, system properties and
measures. Magnitude and adimensional are the two types of variables.
Add or remove any number of items with the buttons attached to each
table. Once you have finished, save the changes and proceed to the next step. 

.. image:: /_static/edt-02.png
   :width: 640
   :target: /_static/edt-02.png
   :align: center 

If the experiment does not include a set of expressions, it would not be possible to
analyze the results. Mathematical relations or dependencies between the previous
variables have their right place in the second tab of the domain.

.. image:: /_static/edt-03.png
   :width: 640
   :target: /_static/edt-03.png
   :align: center 

It is time to give a name to your experiment. And we cannot forget about the main
purpose of this tool: the hypothesis that must be verified later in the laboratory. In the
bottom of the page there are also three selection menus. Please choose the set of
variables from the stored domain.

.. image:: /_static/edt-04.png
   :width: 640
   :target: /_static/edt-04.png
   :align: center

Last but not least, fill the specific values for the experiment variables. As you can see,
the list only contains the selected items from the last tab.

.. image:: /_static/edt-05.png
   :width: 640
   :target: /_static/edt-05.png
   :align: center

The experiment design is ready to start. Variables only need to be dragged around and
dropped onto the right category ("vary", "keep the same"...). Are your students ready for
the truth?
