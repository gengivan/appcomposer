Adapt Composer
===========


Do you want to customize your concept maps or hypotheses? In this section, 
we will learn to adapt these tools with our own set of elements. As you will see
, only a few clicks are necessary to achieve this goal. That is the motto of
App Composer, the Go-Lab application creator for teachers.

First, let's open the homepage of the App Composer. The adaptor composer
can be found there. Click on the button on the right side of the screen::

Creating a Concept Map adaption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A concept map may have multiple variations. If we want to add our own concepts,
we will start by selecting this type of tool in the list:: 

.. image:: /_static/png/cmap-00.png                           
   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

Once the preferred type has been selected, the name and (optional) description 
have to be inserted in the next page. The "Build it" button has to be pressed 
to go to the next step::

   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

If everything was done as described, you will find an empty form. Proceed to 
enter the concepts for your map by typing them consecutively. Press enter before 
adding each concept. When you have finished, click on "Save". If everything went 
smoothly, a green notification will show up in the top of the page::

   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

As a final step, click on the preview tab to check your work. Drag one of the 
"select or type" boxes in the left toolbar and drop it in the concept map space.
All the concepts that you saved are now available in the dropdown menu::

   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

You are all set to import the map into your Graasp space or ILS. Copy the 
"Widget link" in the preview tab, as it is shown above and discover what your 
students can do::

Creating an Hypothesis adaption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Teachers may be interested in generating a specific set of conditions for the
hypothesis tool. In that case, they can select this type of tool in the adaptor:: 

.. image:: /_static/png/hypo-00.png                           
   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

Give a name and (optional) description to your creation in the next page and
push the "Build it" button:: 

.. image:: /_static/png/hypo-01.png                           
   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

Once the two previous steps have been completed, a list of elements is shown. 
Feel free to edit your own collection of conditionals, inputs and outputs. 
Remember to press enter before adding a new variable. Click on "Save" to store
your values in the App Composer::

.. image:: /_static/png/hypo-02.png                           
   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

Behold your creation in all its glory in the "Preview" tab::

.. image:: /_static/png/hypo-03.png                           
   :width: 300 px      
   :align: center

To import this Hypothesis instance into your Graasp space or ILS, simply copy 
and paste the "Widget link".
