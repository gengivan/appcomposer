What is this?
-------------

The App Composer is an application builder for school teachers. The target is to
make it *really* easy for teachers to develop applications, without coding and
if possible with just a very few clicks. It is part of the `Go-Lab project
<http://www.go-lab-project.eu/>`_.

So as to do this, the App Composer provides a set of Composers. At the time of
this writing, there are two Composers:

 * The :ref:`adapt`. This Composer enables teachers to take existing template
   applications and customize them for their target domain. Then these
   applications can be used by their students. The template set can be increased
   by software developers (read :ref:`adapt_development`).

 * The :ref:`translate`. This Composer takes existing OpenSocial applications
   and enables teachers to translate them to a set of languages an target ages. 
   For example, certain applications could be translated to norwegian for
   students under 12 years old, while the same application could be translated
   differently to norwegian for students who are 16-18 years old.

This way, teachers using the `Graasp <http://graasp.epfl.ch>`_
`Personal Learning Environment
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment>`_ can benefit of
adding their customized applications.
