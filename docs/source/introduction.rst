What is this?
-------------

The App Composer is an application builder for school teachers. The target is to
make it *really* easy for teachers to develop applications, without coding and
if possible with just a very few clicks. It is part of the `Go-Lab project
<http://www.go-lab-project.eu/>`_.

So as to do this, the App Composer provides a set of Composers. At the time of
this writing, there are two Composers:
 * The :ref:`adapt`.
 * The :ref:`translate`.
