Develop the App Composer
========================

The App Composer is an Open Source project relying exclusively in Open Source
technologies. All the code is in our `repository <http://github.com/porduna/appcomposer/>`_. 

Pull requests are welcome. Additionally, you may develop your own adaptors for
the Adapt Composer using the plug-in API (see :ref:`adapt_development`).

License
-------

We still have not considered which particular Open Source license to use, but it
will be Open Source for sure. Stay tuned ;-)
