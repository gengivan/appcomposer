Adapt plug-in development
-------------------------

The target of this section is to show how to develop new adaptors for the
:ref:`Adapt Composer`. The Adapt Composer aims to enable teachers to develop
their own applications easily. So as to do this, it provides a simple model to
develop these applications, which can later be configured by the teacher, and
are once customized they are available to students.

So as to develop new adaptors, some software development skills are required. At
the moment of this writing, basic knowledge of the `Python programming language
<http://www.python.org/>`_, as well as HTML5, is required. 

.. note::
    We are designing a new approach that would not require any Python code.
