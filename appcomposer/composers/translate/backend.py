 NOTE ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE APP TO BE TRANSLATED:
 The App to be translated should be already internationalized and should contain at least a reference to one Bundle,
 the Default language Bundle. This is a Locale node on the spec, with NO lang attribute and NO country attribute.
 (If this entry does not exist the App can't be translated).


 FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS:

 The convention we will try to use here is the following:

 Example: ca_ES_ALL.xml (for language files)

 ca would be the language.
 ES would be the country.
 ANY would be the group (the default).

 If any is not set, then it will be replaced with "all", in the right case. For instance,
 if lang is not specified it will be all_ES. Or if the country isn't, es_ALL.

 The default language is always all_ALL_ALL and should always be present.


 OTHER CONVENTIONS / GLOSSARY:

 "Bundle code" or "locale code" refers generally to the "es_ALL_ALL"-like string.
